# Restricted
Restricted-use components for Claromentis. These components replicate functionality within the base Claromentis system, but have been re-implemented in order to overcome shortcomings of the Claromentis' implementations.

## Motivation
Some of Claromentis' default components have either serious flaws, or limitations of functionality. From mini-calendars which start on a Monday instead of Sunday, to polls which cannot be customized enough.

## Warning
These components fall heavily outside of Claromentis support. If something gores wrong, you will not be able to get timely support for Claromentis, and they will likely try to blame these components if they are found on the site (even if the components themselves might not actually be the problem).

## Requirements
This project relies on the following:
- ORM
-
